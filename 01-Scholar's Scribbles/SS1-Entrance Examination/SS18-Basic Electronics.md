1. Resistors:
- Resistors are passive electronic components that provide resistance to the flow of electric current.
- They are commonly used to control the current or voltage in a circuit.
- Resistors are characterized by their resistance value, which is measured in ohms (Ω).
- Example: A 100-ohm resistor restricts the flow of current to 1 ampere when a voltage of 100 volts is applied.

2. Capacitors:
- Capacitors are passive electronic components that store and release electrical energy.
- They consist of two conductive plates separated by an insulating material called a dielectric.
- Capacitors are used to store charge, filter signals, and stabilize voltage levels in circuits.

## 2. Ohm's Law and Kirchhoff's Laws

1. Ohm's Law:
- Ohm's Law states that the current flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage applied across it and inversely proportional to its resistance.
- Mathematically, Ohm's Law can be expressed as: V = I * R, where V is the voltage (in volts), I is the current (in amperes), and R is the resistance (in ohms).
- Ohm's Law provides a fundamental relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in a circuit.
- Example: If a resistor has a resistance of 10 ohms and a voltage of 20 volts is applied across it, the current flowing through the resistor is 20 volts / 10 ohms = 2 amperes.

2. Kirchhoff's Laws:
- Kirchhoff's Laws are two fundamental laws in electrical circuit analysis that help determine the behavior of currents and voltages in complex circuits.
- Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) states that the sum of currents flowing into a node (junction) in a circuit is equal to the sum of currents flowing out of that node. This is based on the principle of charge conservation.
- Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) states that the algebraic sum of voltages in any closed loop of a circuit is zero. This is based on the principle of energy conservation.
- Kirchhoff's Laws are used to analyze and solve circuits with multiple resistors, capacitors, and other components connected together.
- Example: In a circuit with three resistors connected in series, Kirchhoff's Voltage Law states that the sum of the voltage drops across each resistor is equal to the applied voltage.

Understanding Ohm's Law and Kirchhoff's Laws is essential for analyzing and solving electrical circuits, as they provide fundamental principles for calculating current, voltage, and resistance values. These laws form the basis of circuit analysis and are widely used in electrical engineering and electronics.

3. Thevenin's Theorem:
- Thevenin's theorem states that any linear bilateral circuit can be replaced by an equivalent circuit consisting of a voltage source in series with a single equivalent resistor.
- The Thevenin equivalent circuit simplifies the analysis of complex circuits by reducing them to a single voltage source and resistor.
- The Thevenin voltage is the open-circuit voltage across the terminals of interest, and the Thevenin resistance is the resistance seen from the terminals when all voltage sources are turned off.
