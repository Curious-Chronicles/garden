## 1. Number systems

1. Decimal Number System:
- The decimal number system, also known as the base-10 system, is the most commonly used number system.
- It uses ten digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
- Each digit's position in a decimal number represents a power of 10.
- For example, the number 532 in decimal represents (5 × 10^2) + (3 × 10^1) + (2 × 10^0) = 500 + 30 + 2 = 532.

2. Binary Number System:
- The binary number system, also known as the base-2 system, is widely used in digital systems and computer science.
- It uses two digits: 0 and 1.
- Each digit's position in a binary number represents a power of 2.
- For example, the number 1011 in binary represents (1 × 2^3) + (0 × 2^2) + (1 × 2^1) + (1 × 2^0) = 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11 in decimal.

3. Octal Number System:
- The octal number system, also known as the base-8 system, is rarely used nowadays but is still encountered in some contexts.
- It uses eight digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
- Each digit's position in an octal number represents a power of 8.
- For example, the number 47 in octal represents (4 × 8^1) + (7 × 8^0) = 32 + 7 = 39 in decimal.

4. Hexadecimal Number System:
- The hexadecimal number system, also known as the base-16 system, is commonly used in computer programming and digital systems.
- It uses sixteen digits: 0-9 and A-F, where A represents 10, B represents 11, and so on up to F representing 15.
- Each digit's position in a hexadecimal number represents a power of 16.
- For example, the number A4 in hexadecimal represents (10 × 16^1) + (4 × 16^0) = 160 + 4 = 164 in decimal.
