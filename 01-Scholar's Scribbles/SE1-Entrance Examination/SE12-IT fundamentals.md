## 1. Introduction to computer hardware and software

Computer hardware - It refers to the physical parts or components of a computer. It encompasses of the tangible parts (_that takes physical space_). Some of the component computer hardware has are: 
1. **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**: Its the brain and core of the computer system. It helps in operation if calculation and execution commands.
2. **Memory (RAM)**: RAM stands for Random Access Memory, and further divided into S-RAM(_Static RAM_) or D-RAM(_Dynamic RAM_). It helps in storing temporary information that computer might required. 
3. **Storage Device**: It is used for storing information for longer period of time. There are various types of Storage device such as: SSD, and HHD. 
4. **Input and Output Devices**: Devices that are connected to the computer system that helps either in the Input into the system or provide Output to the user. Some of the essential input/output devices are: 
	1. Input - Keyboard, Mouse, and Scanner. 
	2. Output - Monitor, and Printer
5. **Network and Internet**: They are devices and component in the computer system that helps in the access of information across other computer system. It helps in communication and connection between each other. Some of the components are: Router, Hub, Switch and Modem. 

Computer Software: It refers to the program, application, and instruction that tells computer what to do. It consists of intangible (_a.k.a it does not have physical and are digital_). Some examples are:
1. **Operating System (OS)**: It is the core of software that manages the computer resources and provide an interface for users to interact with the computer.
2. **Application**: They are software programs that make use of the resources of physical component to perform a set of command or tasks.
