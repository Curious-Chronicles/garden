# Use research to inform ideation

### Empathy Map 
It helps UX designers understand the behavior of the user and their needs.

### Personas
Fictional users whose goals and characteristics represent the needs of a larger group of user.

1. What are user goals
2. What is need for user in the applicating? 

### User story
Determine which user needs are the most critical to address with your design

### User journey
is the series of  experiences a user has as they interact with your product

### Problem Statement
A clear description of the user’s need that should be addressed. The problem statement you created in the last course will guide the focus of your ideation. 
```ad-hint
[User name] is a/an [user characteristics] who needs [user need] because [insight].
```

```ad-example
Sawyer is a construction business owner who needs to attend local trade conferences because they need to network to find more clients. 
```

# Create goal statements

### Product goal statement
One or two sentences that describe a product and its benefits for the user. Goal statements cover *who* the product will serve, *what* the product will do, and *why* the product solves the user's need. 


**To get the answer to**

Who, What and Why, you can either use the problem statement or, 

1. Who -> persona. 
2. What -> user story. 
3. Why -> empathy maps and user journey. 

```ad-hint
Our [product] will let users [perform specific actions] which will affect [describe who the action will affect] by [describe how the action will positively affect them]. We will measure effectiveness by [describe how you will measure the impact].
```
```ad-example
Our TradeConference app will let users expand their business which will affect how business owners connect with new clients by giving them the ability to connect with clients at local trade shows. We will measure effectiveness by analyzing show attendance.
```

# Storyboard

A series of panels or frames that visually describe and explore a user's experience with a product.

Storyboard will help showcase the how and why of the application or product. How the user will feel and what type of environment they will use it.

Key elements of storyboard are: 
1. **Character**: users. 
2. **Scene**: user's environment. 
3. **Plot**: benefit of using app or product.
4. **Narrative**: Show situation where user is facing issue. 

Two types of storyboards in UX design are as follows: 
1. **Big picture storyboards**: they carry the user emotion and the overall environment user faces and how our app or product helps them. 
2. **Close-up storyboards**: they show the in-app flow of how an user might interact with the app or product

### How do you create a big picture storyboard

1. Start with a problem statement: This will help in character, and scene.
2. Create a goal statement: This will help in creating plots. 
3. Set up the storyboard
4. Add the storyboard scenario
5. Draw one idea per panel: Add emotion and feels to the story as it process.
6. Expose pain points for the user along their journey.
7. Include the user goal or conclusion in the final panel.

2. The starting of the page 
3. Logs in, what is shown
4. Action he wants to do. 
5. Success of the action.
